## **1.** [Natural Number Calculator](https://github.com/julian-irizarry/programming/tree/main/NaturalNumberCalculator)

Created a functional Natural Number calculator graphical user interface (GUI) using the Swing framework and components designed following the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern.

## **2.** [Glossary](https://github.com/julian-irizarry/programming/tree/main/glossary)

Given a .txt file structured as a term on one line, the definition on the next, and then a blank line separating the next term, a sorted html glossary with clickable links to the definitions is created. The glossary was implemented using a (key,value) data structure.

## **3.** [CryptographicUtilities](https://github.com/julian-irizarry/programming/tree/main/CryptoUtilities)

Determines whether or not a very large number is prime using Fermat's little theorem:
* If n is prime and 1 < w < n – 1, then w2 mod n ≠ 1.
* If n is prime and 0 < w < n, then wn – 1 mod n = 1.
* If n is composite (i.e., not prime) and 1 < w < n, then it is "likely" that wn – 1 mod n ≠ 1.

JUnit testing used to test the bounds in the program and any oddities.

## **4.** [String Reassembly From Fragments](https://github.com/julian-irizarry/programming/tree/main/reassembly)

A .txt file that is fragmented is reassembled through overlapping prefixes and suffixes. The strings with the most overlap are combined and the process is continued until there are no suffixes and prefixes that are overlapping.
